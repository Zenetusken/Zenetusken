## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome do Andrei's personal Githib repository. 

Currently enrolled in a Dawson program in regards to CCNA and Linux networking, I base my working projects mainly in regards to these topics as well as the development of tools I need in order to facilitate my stuies in general. There are a few projects in the pipeline, will share them here as I gather the resources and knowledge to develop them. Be patient as I'm very raw! ;-)

Things I'm interested in are:

- Networking 
- Cybersecurity
- Automation
- Artificial Intelligence
- Much more...

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with anything coding related, since this is all very new to me. 

ðŸ“« How to reach me: andre.zen799@gmail.com my personal e-mail address.

Enjoy!!!
