## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome do Andrei's personal Githib repository. 

As an aspiring Network and Security Engineer, I'm currently enrolled in a Dawson program in regards to CCNA and Linux networking, I base my working projects mainly in regards to these topics as well as the development of tools I need in order to facilitate my stuies in general. There are a few projects in the pipeline, will share them here as I gather the resources and knowledge to develop them. Be patient as I'm very raw! ;-)

Things I'm interested in are:

- Networking and Security 
- All facets of Cybersecurity
- Automation
- Gen Ai / Machine Learning
- Developing applications
- Much more...

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with anything coding related, since this is all very new to me.

Enjoy!!!
