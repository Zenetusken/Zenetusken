# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to Andrei's personal Githib repository. 

As an aspiring Network and Security Engineer, I'm currently enrolled in a Dawson program in regards to CCNA and Linux networking, I base my working projects mainly in regards to these topics as well as the development of tools I need in order to facilitate my stuies in general. There are a few projects in the pipeline, will share them here as I gather the resources and knowledge to develop them. Be patient as I'm continuously learning in order to better myself! ;-)

My areas of interest are in:

- Networking and Security 
- All facets of Cybersecurity
- Automation
- Gen Ai / Machine Learning
- Developing applications
- Much more...

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with anything coding related, since this is all very new to me. 

ðŸ“« How to reach me: andre.zen799@gmail.com works best for now.

*This is still under construction and will be updated as I learn, in the meantime... **Enjoy!!!***
